# getting started

open up controller.html. visualizer will open up in separate tab. If desired you can display on a separate screen. Click play to start audio reactive version, otherwise pick a song with the picker. 

You can also pick videos to play over the surface area (i.e. similar to VJing)

If using the onboard microphone it will often filter out any speaker output coming from the same device, so it is recommened to using the picker in this case or use external input. 

# how it works

Uses a spectrum analizer to break music into bands, isolate tones, and then make the music visible by assigning each tone to a section of a sphere.

# why?

Looks cool during a performance. May also help you to play better music by *seeing* the music.

Sound reactive input signal is split into bands logarithmicly mapped to the vertices on a sphere, equalized manually and distributed into polygons.

Sound bands are mapped as edges between vertices mapped over the surface of a sphere. Allows dynamic hues.
