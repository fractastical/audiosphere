MAJOR BUGS

is now squished a bit 

TODO 

midi
    - parse midi file and determine unique notes
    - generate sphere with notes linked to verticies 
    - pulse vertice when note is played

do "sphere" fade in 
    - very low thresholds
    - then gradually increase to baseline

setup more fans
find promo videos 
setup insta
script to integrate inline TODOs with github issues(?)
remap hertz bands
figure out how to make and program remote 

BUGS


videourl passing is borked (i.e. "fakeurl") (including with offset ) error to fix:
"message-controller.js:40 Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute 'createObjectURL' on 'URL': Overload resolution failed."

hueoffsetspeed no longer works for unknown reasons

EXTRA 

change readme so has prettier pictures 

MIDI
    - allow midi input
    - label scale
    - match chordes

extend opacity range  
    (centers around .2-.3)  var opacitylevel =  (7 / volume ) + .2;


DONE

rename sonic sphere

rename files 


video playback is sometimes *way* too fast


pull libraries local so can run offline
two way message passing so controls are separate window
video intregration 
refactor all code, remove unused libraries
Integrate equalizer with nodesphere so both run at sametime
fill in polygons so that there is a fade on opacity 

DEFERRED 

allow a "conway's game of life" style effect where the structures grow if the next set of lines is adjacent
