BUGS


videourl passing is borked (i.e. "fakeurl") (including with offset ) error to fix:
"message-controller.js:40 Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute 'createObjectURL' on 'URL': Overload resolution failed."

hueoffsetspeed no longer works for unknown reasons

EXTRA 

change readme so has prettier pictures 

MIDI
    - allow midi input
    - label scale
    - match chordes

extend opacity range  
    (centers around .2-.3)  var opacitylevel =  (7 / volume ) + .2;


DONE

video playback is sometimes *way* too fast


pull libraries local so can run offline
two way message passing so controls are separate window
video intregration 
refactor all code, remove unused libraries
Integrate equalizer with nodesphere so both run at sametime
fill in polygons so that there is a fade on opacity 

DEFERRED 

allow a "conway's game of life" style effect where the structures grow if the next set of lines is adjacent
