MAJOR BUGS

TODO 

    allow multiple tracks to be played side by side

    What i think is a bug where you need to also click "Start" even if you've picked music. 
    something serious is broken in sthe spectrum analyzer because it is not distributnig well anymore (even on pretrained music)

    Ponse butterfly filter 
        - put in images
        - train on music
        - isolate colors
        - export as video (?)

    Presets (request from seb) for music types 

    Berlioz 
        test midi code
        load symphonie fantasique midi
        isolate instruments with nested spheres
        load mp3 so can play along side midi 
        - match tempo 
        live concert?

    change mode to dropdown
    allow easy toggle between modes (poly, node, video, etc)
    further improve readme
        - alighment
        - group viduals
        - use markovjr as template 

    test playrate update on video from controller BROKEN
    commission more classical music 

REQUESTS DRF (Rootflute)

        Midi template for touch osc 
        With large labeled buttons
        Multiple plug and play presets for new users 
        Operation manual in pdf
        Instructions on how to add your own videos 
        iPad iPhone version that works with touch osc

    Midi commands  (for controller)

        Faders~
        Speed 
        Size / zoom in / out 
        Rotation vertical 
        Rotation horizontal 
        Time of video play (per video I assume)
        + plus visual stuff like Contrast/Saturation (from T)

    Buttons 

        Link to video banks (need to think since these tend to be proprietary, maybe can preload some free free ones)
        Sequence of buttons 
        Create video arrangements for quick automation



== LOW ==

created tagging of videos by keywords (possibly based on filename)
auto populate video queue from folders IMPOSSIBLE
active geometry limit not working (not sure about this, test)

midi
    - parse midi file and determine unique notes
    - generate sphere with notes linked to verticies 
    - pulse vertice when note is played

do "sphere" fade in 
    - very low thresholds
    - then gradually increase to baseline

setup more fans
script to integrate inline TODOs with github issues(?)
remap hertz bands
figure out how to make and program remote 

BUGS


hueoffsetspeed no longer works for unknown reasons

EXTRA 

change readme so has prettier pictures 

MIDI
    - allow midi input
    - label scale
    - match chordes

extend opacity range  
    (centers around .2-.3)  var opacitylevel =  (7 / volume ) + .2;


DONE
fix flashing

videourl passing is borked (i.e. "fakeurl") (including with offset ) error to fix:
"message-controller.js:40 Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute 'createObjectURL' on 'URL': Overload resolution failed."

create log of all actions done with time stamp (so can be recareated)
change toggles to sliders or "on/off" or buttons for key lements (like video change) 
add render density to slider
find promo videos 
setup insta (sonicsource code,done)

sample inbound harp and label tones
hotkey to bring back menu
create list of all files in queue
stylesheet for controller 
bidirecitonal communication
